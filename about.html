        <h3 class="about-title">The soundtrack</h3>

        <p>
            "A Shattered Illusion" conveys exactly what its name entails.
        </p>
        <p>
            "A Complete and Utter Destruction of the Senses" perfectly portrays the level it takes place in, "A Burning World".
        </p>
        <p>
            "Le Castlevein" starts off instantly, no filler or calming music. The layer of Hell known as Limbo is trying as hard as it can to stop you throwing more enemies than ever at you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, "Claude Debussy: Claire De Lune" plays right before the final fight of Limbo. It encapsules the feeling of "calm before the storm".
