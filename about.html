    <h3 class="about-title">The Soundtrack</h3>
    <p>The soundtrack of ULTRAKILL has a new song each level and a theme each layer. Below is a taste of the songs used in the layer of hell called Limbo.</p>
    <p>
        "A Thousand Greetings" really feels 'heaven' has just accepted you. You did it. All of your trials and tribulations finally payed off, relax (transition to "A Shattered Illusion").
    </p>
    <p>
        <audio controls>
            <source src="sounds/athousandgreetings.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
            </audio>
    </p>
    <p>
        "A Shattered Illusion" conveys exactly what its name entails.
    </p>

            </audio>
    </p>
    <p>
        "A Complete and Utter Destruction of the Senses" perfectly portrays the level it takes place in, "A Burning World".
    </p>

            </audio>
    </p>
    <p>
        "Castle Vein" starts off instantly, no filler or calming music. Limbo is trying as hard as it can to stop you throwing more enemies than ever at you.
    </p>

            </audio>
    </p>
    <p>
        "Claude Debussy: Claire De Lune" plays right before the final fight of Limbo in the level "Claire de Lune". It encapsulates the feeling of 'calm before the storm'.
    </p>

            <source src="sounds/debussy.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
            </audio>
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, "Versus" starts right as a red robot known as V2 enters a church. This iconic song plays for the fisrt and last time you fight V2.
