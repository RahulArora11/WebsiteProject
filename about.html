        <h3 class="about-title">Why this game is interesting</h3>
        <h4 class="about-title">Level Design</h4>
        <p>
            Levels in this game are themed depending on what layer of Hell you're in. Let's say that you are in the layer called Wrath. Wrath takes place during a relentless storm, representing the title while also providing a new environment. During the level "Ship of Fools" you make your way from one side of a sailboat to the other, however, at one point a leviathan flips your boat over complete changing the way the level is played. At first you were going through normal, but now you are backtracking the ceiling of the ship, completely changing the awy you play.
        </p>
        <h4 class="about-title">Style Meter</h4>
        <p>
            The Style Meter is a mechanic that that shows a letter grade depending on your style. Progress through letters D,C,B,A,S,SS,SSS, and ULTRAKILL to achieve style points to reach Perfect rank on that level. Finishing off enemies with different weapons, ricochets, punches, and more to rank up style.

        <h3 class="about-title">The soundtrack</h3>
        <p>
            "A Shattered Illusion" conveys exactly what its name entails.
        </p>
        <p>
            "A Complete and Utter Destruction of the Senses" perfectly portrays the level it takes place in, "A Burning World".
        </p>
        <p>
            "Le Castlevein" starts off instantly, no filler or calming music. The layer of Hell known as Limbo is trying as hard as it can to stop you throwing more enemies than ever at you.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Claude Debussy: Claire De Lune" plays right before the final fight of Limbo. It encapsules the feeling of "calm before the storm".
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, "Versus" starts right as a red robot known as V2 enters a church. This iconic song plays for the fisrt and last time you fight V2.
