        <h3 class="about-title">The soundtrack</h3>
        <p>The soundtrack of ULTRAKILL has a new song each level and a theme each layer. Below is a taste of the songs used in the layer of hell called Limbo.</p>
        <p>
            "A Shattered Illusion" conveys exactly what its name entails.
        </p>
        <p>
            <audio controls>
                <source src="sounds/homebackgroundmusic.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
              </audio>
        </p>
        <p>
            "A Complete and Utter Destruction of the Senses" perfectly portrays the level it takes place in, "A Burning World".
        </p>
        <p>
            <audio controls>
                <source src="sounds/homebackgroundmusic.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
              </audio>
        </p>
        <p>
            "Le Castlevein" starts off instantly, no filler or calming music. The layer of Hell known as Limbo is trying as hard as it can to stop you throwing more enemies than ever at you.
        </p>
        <p>
            <audio controls>
                <source src="sounds/homebackgroundmusic.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
              </audio>
        </p>
        <p>
            "Claude Debussy: Claire De Lune" plays right before the final fight of Limbo in the level "Claire de Lune". It encapsulates the feeling of 'calm before the storm'.
        </p>
        <p>
            <audio controls>
                <source src="sounds/homebackgroundmusic.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
              </audio>
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, "Versus" starts right as a red robot known as V2 enters a church. This iconic song plays for the fisrt and last time you fight V2.
